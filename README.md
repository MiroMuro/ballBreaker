A brick breaker game made with javax swing and Java awt. Has cruddy physics for ball bounce angle and speed.

HOW TO PLAY:
clone the repo, navigate to src/brickBreakerGame/Main.java and run the file.
The game will start by pressing spacebar. If it doesn't, run the file again after closing the non-starting one.

The game ends if you break all the bricks, or if you miss the ball with your paddle.

KNOWN BUGS:
- The brick breaking physics can get pretty clunky and unrealistic at times. Fix coming soong
